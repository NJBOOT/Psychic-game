# Psychic-game
This game compares a user keystroke ('user guess') against a randomly generated "secret letter" (the computer 'guess'). The user has 9 guesses. If the user letter matches the computer letter, the user wins and the counter is updated. If the user letter does not match the computer letter, the guesses decrement by one and the 'letters already guessed' array is updated dynamically on the screen with the incorrect guess. Once all 9 guesses have been exhausted, the user loses and the Loss counter is updated. 

This rudimentary game is a test of basic javascript skills, including the use of arrays, functions, and event listeners.
